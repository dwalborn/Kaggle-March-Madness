##### Contributers
Special shoutout to Michael Feeser, co-author of our prediction algorithm. Our model finished in the top 100 among over 1,500 model submissions in the competition, and correctly predicted the outcome for 47 of 63 games (winner predicted to win with odds greater than 50%). Looking forward to improving upon the result in 2020!
