# Google Cloud & NCAA Men's ML Competition 2019
### About
Applying logistic regression in Python to predict the outcomes of the 2019 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. To view the code, please refer to the Submission Kernel markdown file, created using Jupyter notebooks. For more information about the competition, please see the [Kaggle Competition Page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2019)

### Exploring the predictions in a bracket
To view how our model scored in the 2019 tournament, you can download the Submission CSV file from the repository and upload it to [the visualization tool here](https://www.marksmath.org/visualization/kaggle_brackets/). The page displays a bracket with games that have occurred shaded according to the prediction. Credit: [Mark McClure](https://www.marksmath.org/)

### Data Visualization
I have also created an [Interactive Data Visualization in Power BI](https://msit.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNmNkMWQ1NzYtZjBkZS00ZjE3LWJlYWItNDBkZTVhNzg5ZDkzIiwidCI6IjcyZjk4OGJmLTg2ZjEtNDFhZi05MWFiLTJkN2NkMDExZGI0NyIsImMiOjV9)
so that anyone can explore the NCAA basketball data.

### Contributers
Special shoutout to Michael Feeser, co-author of our prediction algorithm. Our model finished in the top 100 among over 1,500 model submissions in the competition, and correctly predicted the outcome for 47 of 63 games (winner predicted to win with odds greater than 50%). Looking forward to improving upon the result in 2020!
